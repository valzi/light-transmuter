![4 Weeks 1](/posts/4weeks1.jpg)

[4 weeks ago](https://light-transmuter.netlify.com/posts/4weeks/):

This is my wife, Emily. This is one of the flattest images I've been vaguely happy with. The background on the right would probably be better if I made it as white as the background to the left. I didn't. Maybe later.

*Ricoh GR 2. 18mm. ISO 3200. 1/200s. f/2.8. Natural light.*
