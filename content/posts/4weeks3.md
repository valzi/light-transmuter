[4 weeks ago](https://light-transmuter.netlify.com/posts/4weeks/):

My daughter playing with her toy camera. Each day, I engage in an internal debate about what day to give her a real one. When I do, should it be a Fisher Price tank-camera, built for throwing at things? Should it be a film camera with minimal controls and feedback? Should it be a $5 point-and-shoot from the thrift store so she can focus on framing/composition instead of controls?
