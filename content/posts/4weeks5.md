![4 Weeks 5](/posts/4weeks5.jpg)

[4 weeks ago](https://light-transmuter.netlify.com/posts/4weeks/):

I thought this image was going to be about her hand and the leaf, but the ice and rocks are much more interesting. I enjoy looking at this image, but I suspect I'll deem it a failure a year from now - and I'll still enjoy looking at it.

* Feb 20 2019.
* FUJIFILM X-E1. 56 mm.
* ISO 200, f1.2, 1-4000 s.
* Natural light.
* Manual.
